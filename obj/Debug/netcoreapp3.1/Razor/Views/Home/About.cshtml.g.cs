<h2>About me</h2>
<h6 class=""text-left"">I was born in Grand Rapids, MI, and I moved around a few times. I fell in love with computers in the 80s when my dad had a computer lab in his middle school. He brought me there and let me experiment, and I was hooked. This is truly when I started my career. I later went to Rochester Institute of Technology for some undergrad and finished my schooling at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. Many great memories have been made.</h6>
  <h2>Pittsburgh</h2>
  <h6 class=""text-left"">I moved to Pittsburgh in 2018 where I met my beautiful wife, Casey. I have been having a blast ever since I came here. She, myself, and my stepson, Jayce are a motley crew that enjoy doing a number of thing around the city. Pittsburgh is like a small town and a metropolis at the same time, not to mention it is a serious tech hub.</h5>
